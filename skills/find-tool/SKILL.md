# Find an Existing Tool

Before anyone builds a new skill, plugin, or script, check whether one already exists.
This skill fetches the current state of both tooling repos live — no stale catalog.

## 1. Fetch the tool catalog

Run the following `gh api` commands in parallel to discover everything available.

**Skills** (`embarkvetlabs/claude-configs`):
```bash
gh api "repos/embarkvetlabs/claude-configs/contents/skills" --jq '.[].name'
```
For each skill name, read its `SKILL.md` frontmatter (name + description):
```bash
gh api "repos/embarkvetlabs/claude-configs/contents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md" --jq '.content' | base64 -d
```

**Plugins** (`embarkvetlabs/embarkvet-claude-plugins`):
```bash
gh api "repos/embarkvetlabs/embarkvet-claude-plugins/contents/plugins" --jq '[.[] | select(.name | startswith("_") | not) | .name]'
```
Skip any directory whose name starts with `_` (e.g. `_template`). For each real plugin, read its `README.md` if present:
```bash
gh api "repos/embarkvetlabs/embarkvet-claude-plugins/contents/plugins/<name>/README.md" --jq '.content' | base64 -d
```
For skills inside a plugin (skip gracefully if `skills/` subdirectory doesn't exist — a 404 means this plugin has no skills):
```bash
gh api "repos/embarkvetlabs/embarkvet-claude-plugins/contents/plugins/<name>/skills" --jq '.[].name'
gh api "repos/embarkvetlabs/embarkvet-claude-plugins/contents/plugins/<name>/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md" --jq '.content' | base64 -d
```
For agents inside a plugin (skip gracefully if `agents/` subdirectory doesn't exist):
```bash
gh api "repos/embarkvetlabs/embarkvet-claude-plugins/contents/plugins/<name>/agents" --jq '.[].name'
gh api "repos/embarkvetlabs/embarkvet-claude-plugins/contents/plugins/<name>/agents/<agent-name>.md" --jq '.content' | base64 -d
```

**Hooks** (`embarkvetlabs/claude-configs`):
```bash
gh api "repos/embarkvetlabs/claude-configs/contents/hooks" --jq '[.[] | select(.name | endswith(".sh")) | .name]'
```
For each hook, read its header comment (first 20 lines is enough):
```bash
gh api "repos/embarkvetlabs/claude-configs/contents/hooks/<name>" --jq '.content' | base64 -d | head -20
```

Batch these calls aggressively — fetch all skill SKILL.md files in parallel, all plugin READMEs in parallel, etc. Do not fetch sequentially.

## 2. Match against the query

The user's query is in the skill arguments. Scan everything fetched for tools whose description, trigger keywords, or stated purpose overlaps with the ask.

Cast wide — an 80% match is worth surfacing. Rank by fit: exact trigger-keyword match > description overlap > general category match.

## 3. Respond

### If one or more tools match:

For each match, output:

```
**<Tool name>** (`/<skill-name>` for skills · `<plugin>:<agent>` for agents)
Source: <repo> · <path>
<One sentence on why it fits this specific query.>
<Any caveats — things the tool does NOT cover, or extra steps needed.>
```

If multiple tools match, order best-to-worst and note if they should be combined (e.g. `/plan-task` then `/build`).

End with: "No need to build anything new — use the above."

### If nothing matches:

Say clearly that no existing tool covers this. Name the closest thing and why it falls short. Then stop — do not start building.
