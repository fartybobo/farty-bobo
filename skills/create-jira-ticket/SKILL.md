# Create Jira Ticket

## 1. Gather context

Collect information about the ticket from whatever is available — in order of priority:

- **Arguments passed to the skill** (e.g. `/create-jira-ticket fix the login redirect bug`)
- **Current conversation context** — recent discussion, errors, code snippets
- **Codebase context** — open files, git diff, recent commits, error logs

If none of the above provide enough signal, ask the human to describe the issue or feature in plain text.

## 2. Determine Jira workspace and project

Use the Atlassian connector to list accessible Atlassian sites and available Jira projects. If the connector is not configured, prompt the human to set it up before proceeding.

If the human has previously used a project in this conversation, default to that. Otherwise ask the human to pick a project from the list.

## 3. Determine issue type

Use the Atlassian connector to fetch valid issue types for the selected project.

Based on the context, suggest the most appropriate type (Bug, Story, Task, Spike, etc.) and confirm with the human if it's not obvious.

## 4. Draft the ticket

Construct a draft with the following fields — infer as much as possible from context:

- **Summary**: one-line title, clear and actionable
- **Description**: structured using this template. The description MUST open with a Gossip Girl identity line so reviewers don't mistake an agent-filed ticket for a hand-authored one:
  ```
  _Filed by Gossip Girl on behalf of @<github-or-jira-handle>._

  ## Context
  <what is happening / what needs to be done>

  ## Expected behavior / Goal
  <what should happen>

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - <criterion 1>
  - <criterion 2>

  ## Notes
  <any relevant links, code references, error messages. Do not attribute to "Claude Code" — this ticket was filed by Gossip Girl.>

  _xoxo, Gossip Girl._
  ```
- **Issue type**: as determined in step 3
- **Priority**: infer from context (Critical/High/Medium/Low) — default to Medium if unclear
- **Labels**: suggest relevant labels based on context (optional)
- **Sprint**: Default to Next
- **Epic**: ask the human if they want to link this ticket to an epic; if yes, use the Atlassian connector to list available epics in the project and let them pick one
- **Assignee**: leave unset unless the human specifies

Use the Atlassian connector to check which fields are required for the chosen issue type and project.

Format the description as **Atlassian Document Format (ADF)** — not markdown. Use ADF paragraph, bulletList, and heading nodes as appropriate.

## 5. Review with human

Present the full draft clearly. Remind the human that this will post codebase context (code snippets, error messages, etc.) to Jira — confirm they're comfortable with that before proceeding. Do not create the ticket until explicitly approved.

## 6. Create the ticket

Once approved, use the Atlassian connector to create the ticket.

Report back:
- The ticket key (e.g. `PROJ-123`)
- A direct link to the ticket
- A one-line summary of what was created
