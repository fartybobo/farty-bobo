# Reads and addresses comments from humans and other agents on github

1. Fetch the open PR for the current branch. If no PR exists, notify the human and stop. If multiple PRs exist, ask the human to select one.
2. Fetch all unresolved comments. Distinguish between human comments and bot/automated comments — focus on human comments first.
3. For each comment, assess its type:
   - **Code change needed** (nit, low, medium, high severity): add to the implementation plan.
   - **Discussion needed** (questions, architectural debates): flag for human review rather than acting on them.
4. Present the plan to the human: show what will be changed, what needs discussion, and what will be ignored. Let the human decide (address all, address a subset, or ignore).
5. Take actions based on human input. For discussion-type comments, post a reply in the PR thread rather than making a code change.
6. Run `/critique-my-shit` to ensure changes are reviewed, committed, and pushed.
7. Attempt to resolve addressed PR comment threads. Note: resolution may fail for threads you did not open depending on repo permissions — report any failures to the human.
8. Re-request review from the original commenters if they had requested changes or notify them via a PR comment that their feedback has been addressed.
9. After pushing, check CI status using `gh pr checks`. If any checks are failing, invoke `/resolve-ci-failures` to investigate and fix them.
10. This skill covers one round of comments. If new comments arrive after this round is complete, the human should invoke this skill again.
